## 🚀 Integration Strategy

### Hybrid Approach
The project supports both providers, allowing users to choose based on their needs:

result = get_stock_price("AAPL")  # US stock

from tools.zerodha_kite_tool import get_zerodha_stock_data
result = get_zerodha_stock_data("NSE:RELIANCE", api_key, access_token)
```

### Data Standardization
Both tools provide similar data structures for easy switching:

```python
# Both return similar format
{
    "current_price": 2500.50,
    "previous_close": 2480.25,
    "daily_change": 20.25,
    "daily_change_percent": 0.82,
    "volume": 1500000,
    "currency": "INR"
}
```
